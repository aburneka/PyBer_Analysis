# PyBer Data Analysis

## Project Overview 

V. Isualize, the CEO of ride share company, PyBer has asked us to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. V. Isualize has also requested that we create visuals that will show the total weekly fares for each city by type. Finally, the CEO will require a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
